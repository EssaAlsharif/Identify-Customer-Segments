# Identify-Customer-Segments
Unsupervised Learning – Customer Clustering with PCA & K-Means

## 📌 Overview

This project uses unsupervised learning to discover meaningful customer groups from a demographic and lifestyle dataset. Since no target labels are provided, techniques like PCA and K-Means are used to identify hidden structures and segment the customer base.

## 🎯 Goals

Preprocess mixed-type customer data

Reduce dimensionality using PCA

Cluster customers with K-Means

Reconstruct and interpret cluster centroids

Compare customer groups with the general population

## 🛠️ Steps

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, scale features, encode categoricals

PCA: Reduce dimensionality and analyze components

Clustering: Apply K-Means to find segments

Centroid Reconstruction: Transform cluster centers back to original feature space

Analysis: Describe segments and compare them with the general dataset

## 📊 Results

Identified meaningful customer segments

Explained PCA component contributions

Interpreted each cluster’s socio-economic characteristics
